# Shared Tools

This folder contains repository-level helper scripts and templates.

## Local-only scripts

Put machine-specific or one-off scripts in `shared-tools/local/`.
That folder is ignored by git and will not be committed.

## Templates

If a script should be shared with contributors, place a generalized template in a tracked subfolder (for example `shared-tools/templates/`).
